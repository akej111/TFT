<p>Hullo,</p>
<p>I’m fairly active here on the subreddit but never posted a guide before. This past weekend I was struggling in P1/D4 trying to play flexibly and decided to just one trick Aphelios every game, no scout no pivot, and hit Masters in three. I’m gonna talk about how I’ve played the build and some thoughts on one tricking it.</p>

<p><strong>TL:DR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spirit Aphelios is really strong, and not as 1st or 8th as you think.</li>
<li>The core of the comp is <strong>3 Moonlight, 4 Spirit</strong>, where your Spirit units (mainly Ahri) buff up your Aphelios</li>
<li>Perfect items are <strong>GA, Rageblade, QSS</strong> Aphelios (in that order)</li>
<li>Starting item: Sword/Chain &gt; Rod/Bow &gt; Glove &gt; Cloak &gt; Tear/Belt</li>
<li>If uncontested, <strong>you slow roll at 5/6/7 (or any combination of the 3)</strong> depending on the state of your board + your chosen unit</li>
<li>If contested, you rush for full 2* Moonlights, and push levels for 4 Spirit + others as soon as possible.</li>
<li>After the core, you can play mystic as well as any units that provide you frontline. Common units I found myself playing are Shen, Sejuani, Sett, Azir, Zilean.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="items">Items</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Perfect items are GA, Rageblade, QSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First two are 100% mandatory, if you don’t have those two by post-wolves you’re playing for 7th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QSS is also near mandatory if you want to top 2, but occasionally you won’t get all 3 perfect items, and an additional damage/healing/defensive item will work here (HoJ, BT, IE, GS, Trap Claw). Azir gains a lot of value in this situation also, as you can use soldiers as bait</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For starting carousel, this is the order I think is best: <strong>Sword/Chain &gt; Rod/Bow &gt; Glove &gt; Cloak &gt; Tear/Belt</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GA and Rageblade are the two most important items so those components are obviously your priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would consider GA components better as it gives you a better chance to natural a second GA, which is BIS on Ahri so you can frontline her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other items</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zzrot is a great item, uses your belt and extra bows as you only need one. Since you’re usually going for another 3*, makes a great target and additional stall for Aphelios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any tears are ideally for Ahri. Late game if she doesn’t cast, there’s a decent chance you lose the fight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything else you can just slam whatever is around, items for frontline or Ahri. Just remember you can only put two items on your other moonlights (components are equivalent to full items in this case)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chosen-ranking">Chosen Ranking</h1>
<h2 id="insta-pick-ordered">Insta pick (ordered)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moonlight Aphelios, Moonlight Lissandra, Moonlight Diana, Spirit Ahri,  <em>Spirit Kindred/Spirit Yummi</em>*, Hunter Aphelios</li>
<li>Note: Kindred/Yummi Ahri are usually insta picks because its usually too late for a moonlight when you see them</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="very-strong-situationally">Very strong situationally</h2>
<ul>
<li>Moonlight Sylas (not good idea if more than 1 Ashe player in the lobby, unless you already have a regular Sylas 2)</li>
<li>Mage Ahri (if you don’t have Ahri or Ahri 1 later into the game)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="others">Others:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Anything else decent that you can play as frontline if you’re close to level 8 (Sej, Shen, Aatrox etc)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bait">BAIT:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spirit Teemo. Teemo is the most dead Spirit unit, you don’t want to drop Kindred or Yummi since they provide hunter and mystic. (And Ahri is your main AS battery) You’re better off waiting for something else</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="signs-to-play-if-youre-not-a-one-trick">Signs to play if you’re not a one trick</h1>
<p>Be uncontested and…</p>
<ul>
<li>3 item start with a full GA or Rageblade + an extra component that makes another item, with early moonlights</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>One of those instapick Chosens during stage 2 + 2 item components</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="early-game">Early Game</h1>
<ul>
<li>Scout early to see if you’re contested</li>
<li>Econ is top priority. I would be down to play a full moonlight board/int if it meant making econ (uncontested only)</li>
<li>If you are contested, I would not full open, as well as I would buy other units in shop to play for a round or two as long as it doesn’t cost you eco. HP is more important here as you’re trying to top 4</li>
<li>Econ more, remember to not buy other units if you can help it because of the shop changes</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="when-to-roll-uncontested--no-moonlight-sylas">When to Roll (Uncontested + No Moonlight Sylas)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Usually rolling a decent amount of gold at 5 to get your 1 costs.</li>
<li>If you have a chosen that lets you play 4 Spirit 3 Moonlight at 6 (Spirit or Moonlight), and are only a few units off your 3* one costs, I would go 6 and continue slow rolling to have a better Ahri chance</li>
<li>If you don’t have those chosens, and at 4-1 you’re not super close to your have to decide if you’re playing safe or first or eighth</li>
<li>Safe: Start getting ready to go 7 and spike for</li>
<li>First or Eigth: Keep rolling for your 3* Liss and Diana</li>
</ul>
